### Tech used

In developing our web application, we strategically chose a stack of technologies that collectively contribute to a robust and efficient system. The combination of Node.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB was carefully selected for various reasons, each playing a crucial role in enhancing the performance, scalability, and user experience of our application.

##### MongoDB

MongoDB played a crucial role in storing program, partner, and task data for the web application. Its document-oriented, scalable, and flexible nature provided an efficient and adaptable solution for representing and managing diverse types of information associated with programs, partners, and tasks within the application.

##### Express

We chose Express.js for its simplicity and ease of use in building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests Express.js facilitated the creation of RESTful APIs endpoints, establishing a seamless communication channel between the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js)

##### React

React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, played a pivotal role in crafting an interactive and dynamic dashboard on the frontend of our application.

##### NodeJS

Ensure a seamless integration between the frontend and backend, allowing developers to build feature-rich and scalable applications using a consistent JavaScript-based technology stack.

##### Tailwind

Tailwind CSS proved to be an invaluable tool in our styling toolkit, offering a rapid, flexible, and maintainable approach to crafting the visual elements of our application.

##### Jest 

Jest extended its capabilities to support integration testing of entire features or user scenarios within the backend. This holistic approach ensured that different components interacted as expected, providing end-to-end validation of features and enhancing the overall quality of the application.
